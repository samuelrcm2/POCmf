# POCmf

---

Web application for structural simulation of solid propellant motor rockets (Programa de Otimização Computacional de motores de foguetes) in portuguese.

The application was built using React with Redux in javascript for the front-end and Python Flask in the back end with sqlLite3 for the database

## Requirements

To use POCmf you have to install:

- Node 12.16.x or later
- Python 3.8.2 or later

## How to install the Necessary Packages

In your command prompt access the path: `[yourMachine]/POCmf/app-client` and run:

`npm install`

Then access `[yourMachine]/POCmf/POCmf` and run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

With that, you just have installed all necessary packages to run this application

## How to Run

To run the front-end with node you have to enter your command prompt and access the path: `[yourMachine]/POCmf/app-client` and run:

`npm start`

To run the back-end with Python Flask you have to access `[yourMachine]/POCmf/POCmf`, open your python console and run:

`flask run`

Now a web page will open with the POCmf running, if not, you can look on the front end console wich port the local server is running
